# PythonDSandA
What this is: I am currently learning how to implement basic Data Structures and Algorithms. It's hard to find proper help online so I'm posting my commented code here along with visualizations of how some of the more abstract methods work. I just started about a week ago so I'll be updating all the files here as I learn more.

(Where?):Source/inspiration for most of the code written: interactivepython.org 
  Check that website out for more information and to learn from someone who knows what he's talking about way more than I do.
  
Why: I'm learning to implement all of these so I can answer the questions in the 'Cracking the Coding Interview 6th edition' book. Anyone who has the money should buy it. It's been really helpful so far and is written concisely and to the point. IF YOU DONT HAVE MONEY FOR THE BOOK: checkout this repository, interactivepython.org, and learn all this. Then head over to /r/dailyprogrammer, /r/learnpython, /r/learnprogramming, or any of the many coding-question-website links they have on those subreddits. 

If you have any questions about literally anything, contact me and I'll hit you back with an answer. Mostly doing this because I refuse to pay to learn these things and I realize how frustrating it is to learn this all on your own with no proper prior coding experience. I'll  update the comments in my code to reflect any questions I get. 

Lastly: As of writing this (1/7/17), I don't know too much about GitHub so it might take me a while to format everything properly. Suggestions on anything here are always appreciated, be as critical as you can.
