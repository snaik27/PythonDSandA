    "Graph searching! Three types, descriptions:\n",
    "- Depth-First Search: Visit first node, then iterate thru each of it's neighbors. When visiting a neighor of a, visit all of that node's neighbors and so on. If a node as been visited already, don't revisit it. By that I mean mark that node somehow, or put it into a list. Maybe cook it in a stew... Pre/Post/InOrder() tree searching are all forms of DFS. So yeah, recursion. But modified to not revisit nodes, not that you can revisit nodes in a normal tree anyway. BUT you can visit a node that looks exactly like another already-computed node in a tree. So maybe cache(is that the word?) nodes for tree-computation so you don't have to constantly be computing the same node again and again. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1a. APPLICATIONS: Maze solving, path finding, figuring out if a graph is bipartite. Side-note: Check out wiki page on bipartite graphs, definition mentions something about (U,V) disjoint sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Breadth-First Search: Visit node a, visit then its neighbors. Then its neighbors neighbors. And so on. So visiting a node put's that node's neighbors into queue. Literally. Might as well ALWAYS mark the already-visited ones in case there's a cycle. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  2a. APPLICATIONS: TERRIBLY inefficient navigation system(Look into djikstra's? We had to do that by hand in like...algebra2 or something. Maybe that is a BFS...idk I'll look into it later). actually useful examples: \"Flood fill\", or any viral growth pattern(see that sounds sick), figuring out if a graph is bipartite(maybe combo this with DFS somehow?).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Bidirectional search: Running two simultaneous BFS. One from the root node and one from the target node. Alright that answers the single-direction BFS frustration. Learn all the 'advanced topics' search algorithms because DFS and BFS look next-level boring"
